## How to install:

    $ git clone https://github.com/erkemp3/react-technical-test
    $ cd tech-test
    $ npm install

## How to run

    $ npm start

This will run the NASA Search Engine web app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
If you make and save any edits or changes, the page will reload to show these.

## Test

    $ npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Next steps:

The features I want to add when I have time are:

- Error message when no search results are found
- Extra CSS styling so that pictures zoom in slightly on hover
- Ability to display images in full size in a new tab when clicked
